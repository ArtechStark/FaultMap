@article{Zheng2010,
abstract = {This paper presents a frequency identification and disturbance rejection scheme for open loop stable time delay systems with disturbance containing a constant signal and a single sinusoidal signal. Astrom's modified Smith predictor is employed to maintain good setpoint tracking performance. Disturbance rejection controller is designed via internal model control principle and functions as a finite dimensional repetitive controller. Extended Kalman filter is designed to track the frequency of unknown periodic disturbance. The simulation results demonstrate the successful performance of the proposed disturbance rejection method for controlling a linear system with time delays, subjected to both step and sinusoidal disturbances.},

abstract = {Good control of processes with long dead time is often achieved using a Smith predictor configuration. Typically a PI or PID controller is used; however, it is shown in this paper that for some situations improved set point and disturbance responses can be obtained if a PI-PD controller is used. Several methods are possible for selecting the parameters of the PI-PD controller but when the plant transfer function has no zeros, the use of the standard forms provides a simple algebraic approach, and also reveals why difficulties may be encountered if a PID controller is used. Some examples are given to show the value of the approach presented.},

abstract = {A simple method of designing the controllers for a modified form of Smith predictor is proposed for integrating and double integrating processes with time delay. The modified Smith predictor has two controllers, namely, a set point tracking controller and a load disturbance rejection controller for obtaining good set point tracking and load disturbance rejection, respectively. The set point tracking controller is designed using the classical direct synthesis method based on the process model without considering the time delay. The disturbance rejection controller is considered as a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and is designed using optimal gain and phase margin approaches. Set point weighting is considered for reducing undesirable overshoots and settling times in the modified Smith predictor. Guidelines are provided for selection of the desired closed loop tuning parameter in the direct synthesis method and the set point weighting parameter. The method gives significant load disturbance rejection performances. Illustrative examples are considered to show the performances of the proposed method. A significant improvement in control performance is obtained when compared to recently reported methods.},

The method is compared with several existing methods to control integrating processes and it is shown that the proposed method is superior to existing ones.},

abstract = {This paper discusses PID stabilization of a first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) process model using the stability framework of the Hermite-Biehler theorem. The FOPDT model approximates many processes in the chemical and petroleum industries. Using a PID controller and first-order Pad\'{e} approximation for the transport delay, the Hermite-Biehler theorem allows one to analytically study the stability of the closed-loop system. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for stability and develop an algorithm for selection of stabilizing feedback gains. The results are given in terms of stability bounds that are functions of plant parameters. Sensitivity and disturbance rejection characteristics of the proposed PID controller are studied. The results are compared with established tuning methods such as Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon, and internal model control.},

abstract = {In order to identify those multivariable processes with integrating factors in their transfer function matrices, a simple yet robust decentralized identification method from closed-loop step tests is proposed. By the frequency response matrix computed from the closed-loop system data and the knowledge of the decentralized controller, the structural information of the multivariable integrating process is determined firstly and then the continuous parametric model with dead times is approximated similarly with the parameterization of the open-loop stable process. Computer simulations and an application to a 3 x 3 integrating multiple-tank water level system verify the validation of the proposed method even if the closed-loop system is affected by some stochastic noise sources.},

abstract = {Causality inference and root cause analysis are important for fault diagnosis in the chemical industry. Due to the increasing scale and complexity of chemical processes, data-driven methods become indispensable in causality inference. This paper proposes an approach based on the concept of transfer entropy which was presented by Schreiber in Schreiber, 2000 to generate a causal map. To get a better performance in estimating the time delay of causal relations, a modified form of the transfer entropy is presented in this paper. A case study on a simulated chemical process is performed to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

abstract = {The paper extends a recent work on a modified PI-PD Smith predictor, which leads to significant improvements in the control of processes with large time constants or an integrator or unstable plant transfer functions plus long dead time for reference inputs and disturbance rejections. Processes with high orders or long time delays are modeled with lower order plant transfer functions with longer time delays. The PI-PD controller is designed so that the delay-free part of the system output will follow the response of a first-order plant or second-order plant, where it is appropriate, assuming a perfect matching between the actual plant and model in both the dynamics and time delay. The provided simple tuning formulas have physically meaningful parameters. Plant model transfer functions and controller settings are identified based on exact analysis from a single relay feedback test using the peak amplitude and frequency of the process output. Examples are given to illustrate the simplicity and superiority of the proposed method compared with some existing ones.},

abstract = {Autotuning using relay feedback is widely used to identify low order integrating plus dead time (IPDT) systems as the method is simple and is operated in closed-loop without interrupting the production process. Oscillatory responses from the process due to ideal relay input are collected to calculate ultimate properties of the system that in turn are used to model the responses as functions of system model parameters. These theoretical models of relay response are validated. After adjusting the phase shift, input and output responses are used to find land mark points that are used to formulate algorithms for parameter estimation of the process model. The method is even applicable to distorted relay responses due to load disturbance or measurement noise. Closed-loop simulations are carried out using model based control strategy and performances are calculated.},

@article{Akpan2011,
abstract = {This paper presents two new adaptive model predictive control algorithms, both consisting of an on-line process identification part and a predictive control part. Both parts are executed at each sampling instant. The predictive control part of the first algorithm is the Nonlinear Model Predictive Control strategy and the control part of the second algorithm is the Generalized Predictive Control strategy. In the identification parts of both algorithms the process model is approximated by a series-parallel neural network structure which is trained by a recursive least squares (ARLS) method. The two control algorithms have been applied to: 1) the temperature control of a fluidized bed furnace reactor (FBFR) of a pilot plant and 2) the auto-pilot control of an F-16 aircraft. The training and validation data of the neural network are obtained from the open-loop simulation of the FBFR and the nonlinear F-16 aircraft models. The identification and control simulation results show that the first algorithm outperforms the second one at the expense of extra computation time.},

abstract = {A novel algorithm for PID controllers based on dead-beat control and fuzzy inference mechanism is presented in this paper. The proposition is an extension of the work by the authors where the PI form of the algorithm was presented. The inclusion of the derivative term makes the method suitable for application in all types of processes including the ones having high rate disturbances. The proposed algorithm seems to be a complete and generalized PID autotuner as can be seen by the simulated and experimental results. In all the cases the method shows substantial improvement over the controller tuned with Ziegler Nichol's formula and the PI controller proposed in R. Bandyopadhyay, D.

abstract = {Based on a closed-loop step response test, a model identification method is proposed for integrating processes with time delay in this paper. By introducing a damping factor to the closed-loop step response for realization of the Laplace transform, a frequency response estimation algorithm is developed in terms of the closed-loop control structure used for identification. Correspondingly, two model identification algorithms are derived analytically for obtaining the widely used low-order process models of first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) and second-order-plus-dead-time (SOPDT), respectively. Illustrative examples from the recent literature are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed identification algorithms.},
