\section{Introduction and background}

Inadequate instrumentation and control engineering staff are not able to ensure that all control loops are operating satisfactory at all times.
The large number of loops present on a typical industrial chemical processing plant necessitates the prioritization of control loop maintenance and optimization.
Base layer control engineers and technicians often follow a “fighting today’s fire” approach as no definite measure is available to identify the faulty control loops that have the highest effect on overall performance.

Connectivity, historical data and economical attributes should be combined to identify control loops with the greatest influence on profitability and/or stability.
This will allow more efficient use of control engineer and instrumentation specialist man hours, in turn leading to safer and more economical plant operation.


The aim is to provide base layer control engineers and instrumentation specialists a definite list of the most important control loops in need of attention.

On a typical large scale industrial complex base layer control maintenance is an ongoing process.
It is quite common to find that the number of control loops in need of attention far exceeds the required manpower available.
The typical troublehsooting procedure followed can bed divided into two parts:
(1) identifying out of control loops and
(2) finding the root cause of the identified control loops being out of control.

Numerous methods and tools are available to aid in the identification of out of control loops.
These are easily implemented and generally function as expected.
In the industrial case being investigated, a simple rudimentary method based on the flagging of loops that have been placed in manual by panel operators combined with identification of loops that fail to maintain setpoints within specified margins have been used with great success and already identifies more loops than can be handled.

The reasons for control loops failing to meet objectives can be numerous.
One reason for poor control loop performance is simply that the controller was never tuned to meet basic robustness and performance criteria, but simply to provide good enough performance to allow the process to be commissioned for the first time.
A second reason for poor control loop performance arises from poor management of change when process feed or conditions have been altered or a general modification has been done, such as a heat integration network being implemented.
A third reason for a sudden drop in control loop performance is related to hardware maintenance issues, such as control valve hysteresis or sticking, or the clogging of heat exchangers, the deactivation of catalysts, etc.
Although valve positioners are an effective solution to control valve hysteresis or sticking, many of the older plants do not make widespread use of valve positioners.
Drastic control loop performance deterioration related to a mechanical failure of some sort is usually quickly identified by panel operators who place the loop in manual, causing it to flag on the base layer control engineers' list of loops in need of attention.

The second aspect of base layer control loop maintenance, namely finding the root cause, is one of the most time-consuming activities involved in control loop troubleshooting.
In identifying possible sources of poor control loop interaction, experienced control engineers rely on intuition that was build over many years to identify the most likely cause.
A significant portion of this intuition is sourced from simply knowing how the different control loops are interconnected, and thus able to interact with each other in a detrimental way.
For example, it is quite common to find that the source of a quality specification being violated lies in upsets in the feed or poor control in recycle streams.

It is proposed that by combining the information contained in plant pipeline and instrumentation diagrams as well as employing measures to assign a metric of interaction between control loops, the important and time consuming task of addressing the root cause instead of the symptoms can be significantly aided.

It is the situation on many large industrial plants in South Africa that a significant portion of the plant operators are starting to reach the end of their careers almost simultaneously and are being replaced by unexperienced youths. Sadly, no great effort has been made to encourage the old generation of operators to convey the peculiarities of the plant and general technical tips in general to the younger generation.

The provision of a metric that can assist in procedures that previously relied on intuition acquired by experience is expected to be a significant aid in maintaining a workable contingency plan with respect to plant operations.


Tight mass and heat integration on large-scale plants lead to significant control loop interaction.
Plants with recycle also commonly suffer from control loop interaction~\cite{Bauer2005a}

Motivations for data-driven root cause plant-wide disturbance and fault detection include (1) streamlining troubleshooting, reducing manhour requirements, (2) yield information to enhance maintencane efforts during plant shutdown and (3) discover problems not found with traditional "fight today's fire" approaches.~\cite{Bauer2005a}

Fault detection and diagnosis of plant-wide disturbances can be approached either by model-based or data-driven methods.
Data-driven methods are generally preferred accurate process models are rarely available - it is estimated that only about 5\% of processes are modelled~\cite{Bauer2005a}. % Secondary reference from conference oral presentation

Model-based techniques compare model parameters agains measurements, while data-driven methods are based on historical proces data.

Measuring the degree of interaction between control loops and ranking them accordingly is considered to be an important yet challenging task~\cite{Rahman2011}.

Although a  number of methods have been proposed and tested with varying degrees of success, most require plants to be step tested in order to determine useful interaction measures.
Step testing can be constly and in the case of already unstable plants near impossible.
Management will rarely authorize step testing to be done, and with good reason.

It is suggested that by incorporating interconnectivity information contained in pipeline and instrumentation diagrams (P\&IDs) together with the application of novel interaction algorithms as well as the application of multivariate statistics useful metrics can be derived with none or minimal induced plant disturbances, provided that plant historian data of sufficient resoltuion (short enough sampling interval) can be accessed.

In addition to finding the root cause of problems, performing economical analysis on identified errors based on known interactions can potentially aid in prioritizing control loop maintenance projects.
This will particularly be useful for identifying control loop maintenance activities that may involve significant processing equipment modifications instead of simply altering parameters used by software as these projects are typically associated with higher expenditure.

% How and what exactly are we hoping to learn from the P&IDs that we could not have learned from interaction analyses?
% It is not as if we want to ignore other interactions that might not be immediately obvious from the P&IDs alone!!

\section{Problem statment and research objectives}



\section{Expected contributions}

The main contribution of this paper is the integration of various known ranking, causal mapping and control loop assessment methods into a tool that can prioritize control loop maintenance on a plant-wide or even site-wide scale.
In order to prioritize control loops it is necessary to identify control loops with the largest influence which are performing the worst while having the greatest impact on profitability.



\section{Research strategy}

The research will be entirely based on data processing and software development with no hardware apart from a personal computer of sufficient computational ability involved or required.

Numerous case studies will be carried out in order to evaluate the efficiency and industrial usefulness of the interaction metrics developed.
A number of custom designed scenarios will likely be used in the initial stages of the project to assess the feasibility of methods and compare results over a wide range of potential problems.
Well-known academic example problems such as the Shell control problem as well as the Tenessee-Eastman plant will be studied.
% Shell problem data can be found in Rossi et al. (2006) contained in {Rahmann2011}.
It is planned that data and pipeline and instrumentation diagrams (P\&IDs) from large scale South African industrial operations will be sourced.
At least one business unit operating withing a large industrial complex has already been approached and a promising response was obtained.
Data sourced from industrial operations will likely be denatured to allow for adherence to intellectual property protocols.
However, it should still be useful to determine the real-life usefulness of the developed methodologies in practical industry, and will allow for the methods to be exposed to the difficulties surrounding industry problems, such as limited historian information or low historical sampling intervals.
